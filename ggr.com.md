A lot of stuff on this blog was interesting. Not sure
if repeatable, but maybe worth trying for myself

I liked learning points--to ensure that projects you
work on teach you something about your product, your
users, and are repeatable. You rate your possible
things to do based on these points and try to choose
the highest rated ones.

I'm not sure I agree with stables and volatiles. I
don't like it when we try to distill management of
people into putting them into boxes. Still, I see the
idea--if your engineers are too focused on stability
they can get paralyzed and never build the next big
thing. (In that paradigm, I'm more of a stable.)

Levels of engineering culture. I heard a similar idea
about devops. Basically, you have to be more and more
repeatable, and fix your process based on real data.
I have never worked anywhere past level 2. Usually,
when we try to reach level 3, we actually have too
much data and focus on the wrong metrics. What are the
metrics for engineering productivity? There's easy
stuff like "oh the deploy process takes too long",
but not really a good way to measure "can't understand
wtf previous engineer wrote".
